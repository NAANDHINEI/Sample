# Organisational

- Three types of learning methods in this courses:
    1. Lectures: 99% Markus showing stuff about computing or python, open forum for discussion and questions.
        - Please ask questions!
    2. Problems: 50/50 Markus and student, co-programming the solution to a problem like Advent of Code.
    3. Projects: Student _owning_ a project with Markus helping by consulting, but giving tools to help yourself doing it in your own time.
        - Izabela: Idea about stock management software with custom reminders. (Markus could help with Frontend/App for it)
